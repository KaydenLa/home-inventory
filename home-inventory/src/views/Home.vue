    <div>
        <p>This applciation is used to keep track and Inventory items within my home.</p>
        <p>In particular, I am intersred in keeping track of the different seasonings, ingredients, and supplies that I have available within my home.</p>
        <p>Each record will be given a unique ID (Primary key) that can be used to search and track individual items. The theory is that I will write this ID on the physical product so that duplicates will not be confused.</p>
        <p>Records will also be given a title, category, and expiration date.</p>
        <p>The system will automatically add when the record was entered into the system.</p>
        <p>Users will be able to search by ID or title and results will be able to be sorted by title, expiring, or date created.</p>
